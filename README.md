# adventure.py

A tiny text-based RPG. Kinda.

# Setup
Ensure that you have Python 3.x on your system.
If not, download it from the official [Python website](https://python.org).
Once you have Python 3.x installed, clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Caephler/adventure.py.git
```
Navigate to the project folder, and run main.py!
```bash
python main.py
```
or
```bash
python3 main.py
```
Use ```python``` only if the Python3 installer installed itself as ```python``` in your PATH.
